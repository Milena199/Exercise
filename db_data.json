      "body": "You can make a simple frozen strawberry smoothie exciting and new with some of these combinations. If youâ€™ve never made a frozen fruit smoothie before, pick up a bag of berry medley, and either a bag of frozen bananas, or some fresh bananas. You can always peel, slice, and freeze them in small bags.",

      "body": "Use sliced, frozen banana in place of sweetener. It will give the smoothie a boost of sweetness and add creaminess. Berries alone are not that sweet, add in pineapple to sweeten and give a tropical flare. If you want to add greens, try baby spinach. It has practically no flavor.",
